selectPoly
======
A simple selecting module with using interactive points in python
You can change input parameters on the functions as you wish (I gave a sample in the scripts)

**when you run the code, it shows a figure on your screen and you can move the polygonal point(red dot) holding your mouse click**

**All functions is modifiable, I just tried to make it useful.**
